I have long been a creative soul. Honestly, it is what sustains me. I try and find beauty in all things and wish to make life more special 
in the ways that I can. I often find it is in the small details and personal touches - that have the most meaning. I have always been a hard worker
and have never compromised originality and quality by taking the easy road. I believe in the value of craftsmanship and the importance of creating things that are made to last.
I graduated with a Fine Arts degree in design and illustration. After many years working as Design Director for global brand
 leader Omnicom and cosmetics giant Revlon, I had taken a hiatis to care of my three children. I have three beautiful girls, including a 
 set of twins. It was during these formative years, as I continued freelancing and curating creative events and parties for my family, that I created my own small business.
Employing my own talents in marketing, designing, and determining the needs of my clients, proving my leadership and capability in the work force.</p>

<p style="padding: 5%; text-align: center;">
My designs are meant to be thoughtful reminders of events, celebrations and offer smiles in our all too often hectic world. A moment to reflect and cherish the sweet moments in life.
It is the Danish concept of “Hygge”; which stresses the value of comfort, coziness and an overall sense of well being that inspires me. 
I am a determined, educated and passionate individual who believes in the power of creativity to bring joy and meaning to our lives.
Driven towards the goal of creating beautiful and functional designs, I have a passion for bringing ideas to life through my work. 
I have a keen eye for detail and a strong understanding of design principles, which allows me to create visually appealing and effective designs. 
I am also a skilled photo editor, with experience in retouching, color correction, and image manipulation. My versatility allows me to 
be competent in various work environments, and I am always eager to take on new challenges and learn new skills.
